[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-vm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-vm) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/drupal-vm/badge/?version=latest)](http://docs.drupalvm.com)

[Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) is A VM for local Drupal development, built with Vagrant + Ansible.

This project aims to make spinning up a simple local Drupal test/development environment incredibly quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the wonderful world of Drupal development on local virtual machines (instead of crufty old MAMP/WAMP-based development).

It will install the following on an Ubuntu 14.04 (by default) linux VM:

  - Apache 2.4.x (or Nginx 1.x)
  - PHP 5.6.x (configurable)
  - MySQL 5.5.x
  - Drush (configurable)
  - Drupal 6.x, 7.x, or 8.x.x (configurable)
  - Optional:
    - Drupal Console
    - Varnish 4.x (configurable)
    - Apache Solr 4.10.x (configurable)
    - Node.js 0.12 (configurable)
    - Selenium, for testing your sites via Behat
    - Ruby
    - Memcached
    - Redis
    - XHProf, for profiling your code
    - XDebug, for debugging your code
    - Adminer, for accessing databases directly
    - Pimp my Log, for easy viewing of log files
    - MailHog, for catching and debugging email

It should take 5-10 minutes to build or rebuild the VM from scratch on a decent broadband connection.

Please read through the rest of this README and the [Drupal VM documentation](http://docs.drupalvm.com/) for help getting Drupal VM configured and integrated with your development workflow.

## Documentation

Full Drupal VM documentation is available at http://docs.drupalvm.com/

## Customizing the VM

There are a couple places where you can customize the VM for your needs:

  - `config.yml`: Contains variables like the VM domain name and IP address, PHP and MySQL configuration, etc.
  - `drupal.make.yml`: Contains configuration for the Drupal core version, modules, and patches that will be downloaded on Drupal's initial installation (more about [Drush make files](https://www.drupal.org/node/1432374)).

If you want to switch from Drupal 8 (default) to Drupal 7 or 6 on the initial install, do the following:

  1. Update the Drupal `version` and `core` inside the `drupal.make.yml` file.
  2. Update `drupal_major_version` inside `config.yml`.

## Quick Start Guide

This Quick Start Guide will help you quickly build a Drupal 8 site on the Drupal VM using the included example Drush make file. You can also use the Drupal VM with a [Local Drupal codebase](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/local-codebase/) or even a [Drupal multisite installation](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/multisite/).

### 1 - Install dependencies (VirtualBox and Vagrant)

  1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (Drupal VM also works with Parallels or VMware, if you have the [Vagrant VMware integration plugin](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware)).
  2. Download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

Note for Linux users: *If NFS is not already installed on your host, you will need to install it to use the default NFS synced folder configuration. See guides for [Debian/Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-14-04), [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS#Installation), and [RHEL/CentOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-centos-6).*

Note on versions: *Please make sure you're running the latest stable version of Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible.

### 2 - Build the Virtual Machine

  1. Download this project and put it wherever you want.
    - **@Debug Academy students:** This step was completed when you cloned this repository. No need to repeat.
  2. Make copies of both of the `example.*` files, and modify to your liking:
    - Copy `example.drupal.make.yml` to `drupal.make.yml`.
    - Copy `example.config.yml` to `config.yml`.
    - **@Debug Academy:** These files do need to be cloned, but do not need to be modified at all.
  3. Edit `config.yml`, set (`local_path`, inside `vagrant_synced_folders`) to the directory you created for your sites to reside.
    - For example, I will be using ~/Desktop/debugacademy/sites/stage
    - Edit *each* local_path variable appropriately. Just update paths from, for example, ~/Sites/haacademyvm, to the location your first site repo resides.
    - You can use relative paths! 
       - For example, you could use this path: `../sites/stage`
  4. Open Terminal, cd to this directory (containing the `Vagrantfile` and this README file).
    - This is the directory named 'academyvm'
    - See 001_command_line_basics.md for information on how to cd
  5. Run the following commands, one by one:
    - ```sudo easy_install pip```
    - ```sudo pip install ansible```
    - ```sudo ansible-galaxy install -r provisioning/requirements.yml --force```
  6. Type in `vagrant up`, and let Vagrant do its magic.

Note: *If there are any errors during the course of running `vagrant up`, and it drops you back to your command prompt, just run `vagrant provision` to continue building the VM from where you left off. If there are still errors after doing this a few times, post an issue to this project's issue queue on GitHub with the error.*

### 3 - Configure your host machine to access the VM.

  1. [Edit your hosts file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file), adding the line `193.169.88.88  academyvm.dev` so you can connect to the VM.
    - You can have Vagrant automatically configure your hosts file if you install the `hostsupdater` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`). All hosts defined in `apache_vhosts` or `nginx_hosts` will be automatically managed.
    - You can also have Vagrant automatically assign an available IP address to your VM if you install the `auto_network` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`), and set `vagrant_ip` to `0.0.0.0` inside `config.yml`.
    - You must run `Vagrant reload` for new options, including these, to take effect if you have previously run `Vagrant up`.
  2. Open your browser and access [http://academyvm.dev/](http://academyvm.dev/). The default login for the admin account is `admin` for both the username and password.

**@Debug Academy students:** At this point, you are done setting up your vm. There is nothing else to do here for this section - jump back to the document that sent you here! Reading more of this file is welcome and encouraged!

## Extra software/utilities

By default, this VM includes the extras listed in the `config.yml` option `installed_extras`:

    installed_extras:
      - adminer
      - mailhog
      - memcached
      - pimpmylog
      # - solr
      # - selenium
      - varnish
      - xdebug
      - xhprof

If you don't want or need one or more of these extras, just delete them or comment them from the list. This is helpful if you want to reduce PHP memory usage or otherwise conserve system resources.

## Using Drupal VM

Drupal VM is built to integrate with every developer's workflow. Many guides for using Drupal VM for common development tasks are available on the [Drupal VM documentation site](http://docs.drupalvm.com).

## Other Notes

  - To shut down the virtual machine, enter `vagrant halt` in the Terminal in the same folder that has the `Vagrantfile`. To destroy it completely (if you want to save a little disk space, or want to rebuild it from scratch with `vagrant up` again), type in `vagrant destroy`.
  - When you rebuild the VM (e.g. `vagrant destroy` and then another `vagrant up`), make sure you clear out the contents of the `drupal` folder on your host machine, or Drupal will return some errors when the VM is rebuilt (it won't reinstall Drupal cleanly).
  - You can change the installed version of Drupal or drush, or any other configuration options, by editing the variables within `config.yml`.
